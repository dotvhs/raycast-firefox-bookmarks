# Search Bookmarks in Firefox

Search and open Firefox bookmarks directly from Raycast.

This Raycast extension is a trimmed down version of Mozilla Firefox extension by @crisboarna and @serhii_kravchenko.

The key differences are:
- It uses shell command instead of Apple Script to open pages making it way faster
- The extension will only focus on bookmarks
- Filters out bookmarklets

TODO:
- [x] Move from Apple Script to shell command
- [x] Do not show bookmarklets
- [ ] Get favicons from Firefox directly instead of Google
- [ ] Remove unnecessary code of removed features
- [ ] Design a new icon
- [ ] Publish the extension
