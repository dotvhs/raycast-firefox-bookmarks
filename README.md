# Search Bookmarks in Firefox

Search and open Firefox bookmarks directly from Raycast.

This Raycast extension is a trimmed down version of Mozilla Firefox extension by @crisboarna and @serhii_kravchenko.

The key differences are:

- It uses shell command instead of Apple Script to open pages making it way faster
- The extension will only focus on bookmarks
- Filters out bookmarklets

TODO:

- [x] Move from Apple Script to shell command
- [x] Do not show bookmarklets
- [x] Get favicons from Firefox directly **(WIP)**
- [x] Remove unnecessary code of removed features
- [x] Read Bookmarks from SQLite as an option **(WIP)**
- [ ] Add sorting options of results
- [ ] Design a new icon
- [ ] Publish the extension
